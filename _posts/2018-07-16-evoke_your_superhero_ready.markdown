I have been so into Marvel Superhero Movies lately so I find this CLI gem project a good chance to write my own CLI app to list all 100 best Marvel Superheroes of all time. 

I always think that the curriculum is quite easy until it comes to final projects. All what I have learned is used in this project which I think is very necessary for me to refresh my knowledge. The project is little overkilled (in my opinion) but I am happy that it is given. Through it, I got to understand better about bundle, rakefile, gemfile, gemspec, and all helpful methods to scrape and display informations from an external webpage.

Now let me fly you though my first project: **Marvel Best Superheroes**

As the title, you would see this is what printing on your terminal when running the code:

Let's choose the OP bagde:

and here is my Iron Man ladies and gentlemen:

How's it? Simple right? I know. But it is the work of few days struggle through step by step so I am very proud of it :D

I think all the methods I know you probably master them. But there is one new feature I just learned while doing the project: **Colorize**

I think it is quite important to make your CLI app more impressive among other thousand CLI gem project. I know there are a lot of gems outthere to help improve your console look but colorize is already enough for this project.

To install, it is as simple as it gets:`spec.adddependency "colorize"` then `require "colorize"` on top of the file you would want to use it. 

To color an output line of code, just simply type` .blue` or `.red `or` .orange`. So as to make it bold type `.bold`, italics `.italics`... or if you want both, just `.blue.bold`. Easy right? like this:

`puts "\n#{hero.name.upcase}\n".bold.red`

or another way to use the code is by typing `.colorize(:blue).bold` but I prefer first way, perhaps so do you cause we programmers are lazy. I admit that

I wish to share more with you more on my upcoming project

***Stay tune and have productive days colleagues !!!***
