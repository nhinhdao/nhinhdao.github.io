I don't know why I use this*** "fancy"*** name instead of **Message Transfer Web Application** or literally **rails-messages-transfer-project** as its name on my github. At least it does imply what it expresses. Sorry **The Face Book** for this somewhat similarity.

Before talking about the highlights, I would like to introduce this project again.

This is not a new project, instead is an upgraded version of the sinatra-messages-transfer-project I have done last month. It is a web application mimicking a social app where user can make friends, send messages to each other. This version, however, I added posts and some other functions and was builded in Ruby on Rails so it is the same idea but has mostly different codes and logics behind. So, let's get started.

This web application is made to run on your local machine [http://localhost:3000](#) so it is half static, half dynamic. It can change connections between users and their activities based on their choices but it is not an online-parellel interactive relationship like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter... All changes happen to one user (local machine) at a time and is stored to his/her local database while the application is running.  I hope to make it go online soon (I want to accomplish it, I really do)

For more details about this app, please review my sinatra-messages-transfer-project post. 

Here I will upload some pictures to show you how my application looks like.
