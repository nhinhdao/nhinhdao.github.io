Not only just me, I know I know. But just give me a moment to praise myself after successfully got out of my comfort zone to stand where I am standing right now. I am at the very first steps of the 10 million stairway steps to heaven just so you know lol.

I am always knowing that I love everything related to Technology. Back in college time, I loved sitting hours in front of my computer fixing my friends' files, slideshows,... to make them look neater, layout better, add some "cool" actions like rotating, slowmotion,... or some icons next to each lesson for higher grades. My friends loved to give me their files as if they were gonna become professional ones after I touched them.

Working my first job in a small hotel as a receptionist, I had chances to help the IT guy to upload our hotel articles to its website, fix layout bugs and report any problem to manager. Highly speaking, I helped 'manage my hotel website' . I learned basic html and css enough to make it look nice and match the website style but I got so many compliments from my coworkers for how I could do it. That feeling was awesome.

I didn't take that chance to made me become a programmer. I didn't think I would be become anyone just by learning on my own. I was too old to go back to college and too afraid to change my job. I thought no matter how hard I tried, boys will always do better jobs than girls in Tech and they will all get hired while I will not.

Yes, that was my mindset. But I can't deny the fact that techlonogy was the love of my life.

It was almost 8 years since I finished college in Vietnam. I worked at a few places and left them after 2 year commitment for I didn't find the urge to stay any longer. 

After moving to America, I had decided to work hard to save up some money to go to college because I wanted to change my career. While I was doing nails job, I met my husband through a colleague of mine. He is a self-taught web development programmer. He showed me his love for programming and taught me the important of being discipline. Through him I found my passion for computer science grow stronger. I decided to pursue it. I found that Flatiron is such a great source of learning materials and challenges to learn at my own pace.

And here I am.
