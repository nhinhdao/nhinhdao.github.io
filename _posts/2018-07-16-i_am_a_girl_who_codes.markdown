Ooops not only me, I know. But just give me a moment to praise myself after successfully got out of my comfort zone to stand where I am standing right now. I am at the very first steps of the 10 million step stairway to heaven just so you know lol.

I am always knowing that I love everything related to Technology. Back in college time, I loved sitting hours in front of my computer fixing my friends' files, slideshows,... to make them look neater, layout better, add some "cool" actions like rotating, slowmotion,... or some icons next to each lesson for higher grades. My friends loved to give me their files as if they were gonna become professional ones after I touched them.

Working my first job in a small hotel as a receptionist, I had chances to help the IT guy to upload our hotel articles to its website. I learned basic html and css just enough to make it look nice and match the website style but I got so many compliments from my coworkers for how I could do it. That feeling was good.

I didn't keep doing it for long. I didn't think I would be anything just by learning on my own. I was too old to go back to college and too afraid to change my job. I thought no matter how hard I tried, boys will do better job than girls and they will all get hired while I will not

Yes, that was my mindset. 

It was almost 8 years since I finished college. I worked at 3-4 places and left them after 2 year commitment for I didn't find the urge to stay any longer. 

I met my husband 3 years. He is a self-touch web development programmer. He dropped out of college because it took too long for him to finish and find a job. He showed me his love for programming and teach me the important of being discipline. Through him I found my passion for computer science. I decided to chase it. I am not good at picking up the material online to learn it myself. I found that Flatiron is such a great source of informations and challenges to learn with my own pace.

And here I am.
